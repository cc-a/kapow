Implementation of a adapter class designed to provide a more Pythonic
interface to the OpenMM molecular simulation toolkit. Taking advantage
of the dynamic properties of the Python programming language this
module mostly aims to circumvent the use of getters and setters in
OpenMM objects, replacing them with the use of properties and more
sophisticated descriptors as required.
